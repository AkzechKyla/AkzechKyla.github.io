# AkzechKyla Portfolio Website v1
I built it entirely with HTML for my web development subject. I only had three hours, so it's pretty basic. Funny enough, I'd been planning to make a portfolio site for ages, but I kept putting it off or overthinking it. Turns out, I just needed a same-day assignment to get it done, haha! Of course, I'll be making a much better one eventually... but this will do for now.
